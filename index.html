            <h1> Hi there, I am Sreekrishna Ramaswamy! </h1>
                <p> I have previously worked at Intel Labs working on developing a feature to
                    improve the single thread performance of the state of the art Intel Processors.
                    I had developed an algorithm used to improve the performance of the modern OoO core.
                    It was targeted to specifically target branch mispredictions in the front-end of the processor </p>
                <p> Prior to this, I was a physical design engineer at Qualcomm, working on improving PPAS
                    of the GPU / NPU cores at Qualcomm. We published a paper and also won the best paper award
                    at SNUG 2018 held in Bengaluru in the IC implementation front. Please refer to following
                    slides for more details on the same. </p>
